Thermal Printer Basics
========================
This example shows how to use the Viper Thermal Printer Library for printing texts.
The Library contains class definitions for the "micro panel thermal printer" sold in shops like Adafruit and Sparkfun (e.g. http://www.adafruit.com/products/597). 
        
This library is an adaptation for Viper www.viperize.it of the Lauri Kainulainen work https://github.com/luopio/py-thermal-printer and it is based on the Adafruit Arduino library developed by of Ladyada.
