ADC Analog to Digital Acquisition Basics 
==================================================

The basic definition of analogRead() in VIPER has the same behavior of Arduino analogRead().

The complete definition of analogRead() is 
analogRead(pin, samples=1, period=100, resolution=ADC_HI_RES, callback=None) 

In this example simple analogRead and advanced multi sample ADC acquisition are reported
