ViperApp Basic
==============

This example is a very minimal ViperApp demo.
Bidirectional communication between the script and the mobile app is demostrated: eveytime a button on the mobile app is pressed, a message is received on the board. Everytime the board button is pressed, a message is sent to the mobile app.
